Created and edited by benpazzo

Hello everyone,

Before further diving in to script details, I've made few adjustments to the KNOB's AI mechanic script and I would like thank him for his AI mechanic script.

AI Mechanic link:



AI Doktor is a script that can be activated with a simple command when you are dead. When you are lying on the ground if type /doktor a npc doctor spawns near you and revives you.

Features:
-If there are 2 or more doctors in the game /doktor does not work.(The reason for that is not to role block or further restrict the doctors in the game)
-Instead of AI mechanic; AI doctors drive vehicles more aggressively.
-NPC model and vehicle model is adjusted for doctor.
-ClearPedTasksImmeddiately(player) has become operational otomatically in order to overcome a bug which makes a player to change location after an vital incident.
-Notification window is adjusted for EMS.

Known Issues:

-Certain places where AI Doktor can't reach are mountains,sea,off roads.If command is used in these areas, you will most likely encounter npc doctors which literally doing nothing.

Türklere selam olsun.
